# AICommandScript (AICS)

A lightweight, natural-language framework for creating structured, shareable AI applications.

## What is AICommandScript?

AICommandScript (AICS) is a framework that allows you to create AI applications using natural language instructions instead of traditional programming code. It's designed to be accessible to non-programmers while providing powerful AI app creation capabilities.

## How It Works

Instead of writing code, you define:

- **Behaviors** - What should happen when (session flow, user interactions)
- **Templates** - How messages should look with placeholders like `[emoji]`, `[user_fruit]`
- **Data structures** - Facts, information, and content your app will use
- **AI instructions** - How the AI should respond and behave

The AI reads these natural language instructions and executes your application accordingly.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language**: Write apps in plain English (or other languages)
- **Shareable**: AICS files can be shared and reused across different AI platforms
- **Structured**: Clear organization with sections for behaviors, templates, and data
- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in support for multiple languages
- **Template System**: Reusable message formats with dynamic content
- **Data Verification**: Distinguish between human-verified facts and AI-generated content

## Example Structure

```yaml
// AICommandScript APP
title: Fruit Quiz
author: Your Name
version: 1.0
type: Quiz App

// BEHAVIORS
- On session start: prompt with [language_selection]
- After language selection: display [welcome_message]

// TEMPLATES
template: welcome_message
Welcome to [title]!

// DATA
fruits:
- apple: üçé
- banana: üçå
```

## Getting Started

1. Check out the examples in the `examples/` folder
2. Use the `AICS-master-template.md` as a starting point
3. Customize behaviors, templates, and data for your app
4. Share your AICS file with others

## Examples

- **Fruit Quiz**: A multi-language quiz app demonstrating core AICS concepts
- **Master Template**: A comprehensive template showing all available features
