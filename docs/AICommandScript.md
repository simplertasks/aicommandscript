AICS


The Goldilocks Problem:
	•	Too little structure → Inconsistent, unreliable, hard to maintain
	•	Too much structure → Intimidating, requires technical knowledge, loses accessibility
	•	AICS → Just right
	
This could be the key to finally bridging the gap between “citizen developers” and professional developers using the same toolchain.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

At its core is Command Script — a lightweight, natural-language framework that gives users precise control over AI. Unlike freeform prompting, Command Script introduces explicit structure, reusable templates, dataset integration, and flow control — transforming raw instructions into reliable, repeatable applications. It preserves the simplicity of natural language while adding the discipline of programming, so creators can design AI interactions that are not just powerful, but also predictable and shareable.
