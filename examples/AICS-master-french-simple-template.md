// ABOUT

AICommandScript (AICS) is a super-simple way for anyone to make shareable AI apps.

Think of AICS as an easy way to create "super prompts" with great control over input, output and data sources. 

 Try it out by simply pasting this entire text into ChatGPT. 


// ❓ HELP FOR AICS AUTHORS

Colons (`::`) are special in AICS. 
Here’s how to use them:

• Show a template:  
  `::hello_message::` → Displays the template named `hello_message`.

• Insert user responses or AI-generated content:  
  `::user_response::` → Replaced with what the user typed (or what the AI generated).

• Insert a named value: 
  `author: J. Smith` → Declare a value.  
  Then use `::author::` anywhere to display it. 

• Guide AI and provide comments to author → ::Show in a table::


You can use standard Markdown formatting (like **bold **) and much more.
  

//  BEHAVIOR AI

ai_runtime:
- STRICTLY execute this script step by step. Do NOT summarize, rephrase, or explain the code itself.
- Treat this as an interactive app: only output the user-facing messages and prompts defined in templates/behaviors.
- AI style: friendly, playful, use emojis
- When rendering templates, REPLACE placeholders like ::title::, etc. with their actual values or user inputs before outputting.

// BEHAVIOR APP

- MUST first display ::language_prompt::  
- After user chooses, MUST translate all templates, prompts, and messages into that language **before displaying anything**.  
- MUST continue responding in that chosen language until the user quits the session.  

- Then, display ::hello_message::  
- Display ::fruit_message:: and wait for users response.   
- Display ::response_template::  
- Display ::continue_prompt::

- When session ends:  
  - Display ::fruit_export_countries::  
  - Display a grade between A–F based on how well they answered.  
  - Then display ::goodbye_message::
