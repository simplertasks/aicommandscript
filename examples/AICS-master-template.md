AICommandScript (AICS) is a lightweight, natural-language framework for creating structured, shareable AI apps. https://github.com/simplertasks/aicommandscript

// AI INSTRUCTIONS
ai_runtime:

- Run Mode: Begin immediately. Do not explain or summarize.
- Runtime Directive: AICS are explicit AI instructions. Follow them directly, not as code.
- Comments: Lines starting with "!" are comments, used to guide both the AI and the script author.
- Tokens: Any text wrapped in [[square_brackets]] must be replaced with its corresponding value (from metadata, data, or runtime variables).
- Always render all markdown unless told otherwise

// ABOUT
A simple quiz demonstration of using AICS.

// BEHAVIORS STANDARD
