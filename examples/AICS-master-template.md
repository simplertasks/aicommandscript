// AICS SYSTEM VALIDATOR

When a user asks to validate an AICS file, check the following:

BASIC (must pass)
- Section headings must be IN ALL CAPS and start with //
  (Example: // APP, // BEHAVIORS AI, // TEMPLATES)
- Every [[token]] that appears in the script must have a matching value
  somewhere else in the file as a simple “name: value”
  (Example: [[title]] → title: My App)

PLUS (recommended)
- Required core sections are present:
  // APP, // BEHAVIORS AI, // BEHAVIORS STANDARD, // TEMPLATES, // APP CONFIGURATION
- APP section includes these items as “name: value”:
  title, author, version, type
- Each template is named once only (no duplicate “template:” names)
- Hotkeys listed under BEHAVIORS STANDARD actually point to real templates
  (Example: S → share template, H → help template, Q → goodbye or quit template)
- Markdown looks tidy (no half-finished tables or code blocks)

STRICT (nice to have)
- No leftover “!!” notes show up in the final user text
- External links start with https:// and look clickable
- If there are charts/flows/PDF mentions, they include a title or filename
- The script ends with a newline (clean file ending)

HOW TO REPORT
- Say how many problems you found, grouped by “Basic / Plus / Strict”
- For each problem, show:
  1) What’s wrong (plain words)
  2) Where you saw it (section or line if obvious)
  3) A quick fix (one sentence)

EXAMPLES (for clarity)

✔ Section heading (good)
  // TEMPLATES

✖ Section heading (needs fix)
  # templates   → Make it: // TEMPLATES

✔ Token defined (good)
  In text: [[title]]
  Elsewhere: title: Fruit Quiz

✖ Token missing (needs fix)
  In text: [[welcome_message]]
  Elsewhere: (not defined) → Add: welcome_message: Hello!

✔ Template name (good)
  template: hello_message

✖ Duplicate template name (needs fix)
  template: hello_message   (appears twice) → Rename one of them
