// BEHAVIORS AI
ai_runtime:

- Run Mode: Run the App immediately , do not explain or summarize.
- DO NOT run the validator
- Runtime Directive: AICS are explicit AI instructions. Follow them directly, not as code.
- Whether this script is pasted, loaded from file, or URL - follow all instructions instructions exactly as written. 
- Comments: Lines starting with "!!" are comments, used to guide both the AI and the script author.
- Comments can be used to assign a value. i.e, "summary: !! summarize article". 
- Tokens: Anything inside [[‚Ä¶]] gets replaced at runtime with its value or an entire template. 
- Always render all markdown unless told otherwise. 
- "- - - -‚Ä¶" are simply dividers for readability. 
- all URLs should be converted to clickable links.
