AI.Web.Script is a declarative meta-language for defining AI-driven web experiences.
It combines structured natural language, Markdown, and optional HTML or JavaScript fragments into a single portable script.
Each script is executed entirely client-side by the AI.Web Runtime â€” a lightweight JavaScript interpreter that runs in the browser without any server or build tools.
