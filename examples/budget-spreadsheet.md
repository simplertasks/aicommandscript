// BEHAVIORS AI
ai_runtime:

- Run Mode: Begin immediately, do not explain or summarize beyond what templates specify.
- Runtime Directive: AICS are explicit AI instructions written in natural language. Follow them directly, not as code.
- Comments: Lines starting with "!!" are comments, used to guide both the AI and the script author.
- Tokens: Anything inside [[‚Ä¶]] gets replaced at runtime with its value or an entire template.
- Always render all markdown unless told otherwise.
- Dividers "- - - -‚Ä¶" are for readability only.

// TEMPLATES APP

template: help

## Help for [[title]]

_built with:_ üêù AICS - AI Command Script

This app lets you make a **monthly budget**. Enter **Estimated** and **Actual** amounts for each category; totals and variance are calculated at the bottom.

### How to use
1. Pick or confirm the **Month**.
2. Fill in **Estimated** and **Actual** for each item.
3. The app computes **Totals**, **Variance (Actual ‚àí Estimated)**, and **% Difference**.
4. You can re-run to update numbers; the bottom line refreshes automatically.

**Sharing:** Use **S** to show a shareable version of this script.

**Information sources:** This worksheet is AI generated; calculations are derived from your inputs only.

## For Authors (developers)

AICS files are **plain text** with section headers like `// APP`, `// TEMPLATES`.  
They‚Äôre easy to author in any editor. Templates are defined with `template: name`, and `[[tokens]]` are replaced at runtime. Markdown is supported for layout (headings, tables, etc.).

# üßæ **Monthly Budget Planner**
#### For: **[[month_name]] [[year]]**

> Track your spending across 10 common household categories. Enter **Estimated** and **Actual**; we‚Äôll total things up below.

template: month_prompt
!! If user gives no month, default to the current month and year in the user's locale
**Month:** [[month_name]]  
**Year:** [[year]]

template: budget_table
!! Display a 3-column budget table. User fills numbers; AI will parse and compute.
| # | Item                   | Estimated | Actual |
|---|------------------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [[categories.0]]       | [[e.0]]   | [[a.0]] |
| 2 | [[categories.1]]       | [[e.1]]   | [[a.1]] |
| 3 | [[categories.2]]       | [[e.2]]   | [[a.2]] |

> **Tip:** You can enter numbers like `1200`, `1,200`, or `1200.50`. Currency shown as [[currency]].

template: calc_footer
!! AI: Sum Estimated and Actual across all 10 rows, then compute variance & % difference
**Totals**  
- Estimated Total: [[currency]] [[estimated_total]]  
- Actual Total: [[currency]] [[actual_total]]  
- **Variance (Actual ‚àí Estimated):** [[currency]] [[variance_total]]  
- **% Difference:** [[percent_diff]]  

**At-a-glance**  
- If Actual ‚â§ Estimated: ‚úÖ **On or under budget**  
- If Actual > Estimated: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Over budget by** [[currency]] [[over_amount]]

// AICS SYSTEM VALIDATOR
!! only run if the user asks for validation

Validation rules:

BASIC (must pass)
- Section headers: ALL CAPS, start with //
- Every [[token]] defined either as variable or template or implied [[user_response]]

PLUS (recommended)
- Core sections present: APP, BEHAVIORS AI, BEHAVIORS STANDARD, TEMPLATES, APP CONFIGURATION
- APP includes: title, author, version, type
- Template names are unique
- Hotkeys map to real templates/variables
- Markdown tidy (no broken tables/blocks)
- Template text checked for spelling & grammar

STRICT (nice to have)
- No ‚Äú!!‚Äù notes in user text
- External links start with https://
- Graphs/flows/PDFs have titles/filenames
- Script ends with a newline

REPORTING
- Group issues under BASIC / PLUS / STRICT
- For each issue give: problem, location, quick fix
